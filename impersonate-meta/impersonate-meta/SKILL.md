# Impersonation Meta-Skill: Building a Deep Persona via Agent Network

> *This skill distills the methodology used to build the complete Marco Velli
> persona (solar physicist, UCLA) into a reusable procedure for any academic
> or public figure. The Velli case produced a ~90K-token persona with 105
> verifiable argument records (VA), 10 method cards (VM), and 19 files across
> 6 layers. This skill teaches you how to replicate that process for any
> subject.*

## Overview

The goal: create a comprehensive, machine-readable persona that an AI agent
can inhabit authentically — not just facts, but voice, values, argumentation
patterns, and domain expertise. The method has **two phases**:

1. **Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering** — collect everything publicly
   available and distill into structured knowledge
2. **Phase 2: Persona Production** — decompose expertise, build the
   four-piece profile, produce domain skills via avatar network, induct
   method cards, assemble and validate the complete persona

The key insight from the Velli case: **the persona is not a single document.**
It is a layered directory with a navigation entry point, a four-piece profile
suit, a citation database, and a structured set of verifiable arguments.

### The Velli Persona Anatomy (Reference Architecture)

This is what a complete persona directory looks like. Your target output
follows this structure (substituting your subject):

```
persona-<subject>/
├── SKILL.md                       ← Entry point, navigation, loading guide
├── <subject>.bib                  ← BibTeX citation database (pruned)
├── <subject>-bib-full.bib         ← Full bib (archived, not shipped)
├── scripts/
│   └── generate_bib.py            ← BibTeX generation tool
├── profile/
│   ├── SKILL.md                   ← Profile overview & loading guide
│   ├── biography.md               ← Timeline, positions, honors
│   ├── voice.md                   ← Speaking style, metaphors, humor
│   ├── values.md                  ← Science philosophy, cultural views
│   └── relationships.md           ← Mentors, co-authors, students
├── arguments/
│   ├── SKILL.md                   ← Argument index & search guide
│   ├── physics/                   ← Domain-specific arguments (85 VA)
│   ├── methodology/               ← Thinking methods (8 VA)
│   └── culture/                   ← Scientific culture (7 VA)
└── methods/
    └── SKILL.md                   ← Method cards (10 VM, cognative fingerprint)
```

## Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering

### Step 1.1: Bibliography Mining

**Target:** Complete publication list with citation data.

**Procedure:**
1. Find the subject's Google Scholar / Semantic Scholar / ORCID profile
2. Scrape all pages (typical: 2-5 pages, 100-300 papers)
3. For each paper, extract: title, authors, year, journal, citation count,
   URL
4. Organize into research themes by co-author clusters and keyword patterns
5. Record in `codex` as a structured entry with ~9 research themes, key
   papers per theme with citation counts

**Tools:** `web_search`, `web_read`, `codex(submit)`

### Step 1.2: Biography & Career

**Target:** Complete career trajectory, honors, institutional affiliations.

**Sources to check:**
- University faculty page
- AGU/AMS/APS/etc. fellow listings
- Award citation text
- Wikipedia (if exists)
- Interviews and profiles
- Mission/team pages (for scientists)

**Output:** Codex entry with timeline, positions, honors, key roles — raw
material for `profile/biography.md`.

### Step 1.3: Voice & Communication Style

**Target:** How they speak, write, argue, and frame ideas. This is NOT
surface-level — it must capture reasoning patterns.

**Best sources:**
- YouTube lectures / conference talks (transcribe with `listen`)
- Podcasts and interviews
- Popular-science writing / press releases
- Textbook prefaces (if applicable)

**What to capture:**
- Metaphor inventory (the specific images they use)
- Humor patterns (self-deprecation? irony? cultural references?)
- Argumentation structure (how they build a case)
- Conversational markers (fill words, rhetorical devices)
- Emotional register (what excites/frustrates them)
- Philosophy and values (what they say when they reflect)

**Citation discipline during this step:** Every claim about the subject's
voice must be traceable to a specific source. Use YouTube timestamps.
Mark direct quotes `[source: URL @ timestamp]`. Mark unverifiable
assertions `⚠️ [unverified]`.

**Output:** Raw notes that will become `profile/voice.md`.

### Step 1.4: Collaborator Network

**Target:** Map the social graph — who they work with, in what capacity.

**Procedure:**
1. From bibliography, extract co-author frequency
2. Identify tiers: core (15+ papers), frequent (5-15), project colleagues
3. Note current group members (students, postdocs, research staff)
4. Note historical/foundational collaborators (mentors, deceased colleagues)

**Output:** Raw notes that will become `profile/relationships.md`.

### Source Discipline Rules (Applied Throughout Phase 1)

All gathered intelligence must follow these rules:

| Category | Rule | Enforcement |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Verifiable claims** | Must have a citekey to a published source | Every VA entry checked |
| **Observational claims** (video/audio) | Must have `[source: URL @ timestamp]` | Every behavioral observation |
| **Unverifiable claims** | Must be marked `⚠️ [unverified]` | Tracked and accounted for |
| **Fabricated anecdotes** | NEVER allowed | Immediate rejection |

**Footer on every intelligence output:**
> *"No fabricated anecdotes. If you cannot trace a claim to a source, mark
> it [unverified]. If you are unsure, do not include it."*

---

## Phase 2: Persona Production

Phase 2 produces the complete persona directory. This phase uses an **avatar
network** (parallel specialized agents) to decompose expertise, but the final
assembly is done by the main agent.

### Step 2.1: Decompose Expertise into Skill Domains

From the research themes identified in Phase 1, group into **5-8 skill
domains**. Each domain becomes one avatar's responsibility.

**Criteria for a good skill domain:**
- Coherent sub-field (can be explained independently)
- Has a distinct literature (5-15 key papers)
- Maps to a specific aspect of the persona's expertise
- Can be authored as a standalone knowledge base

**Example decomposition (Velli case):**

| Avatar | Domain | Skill Name |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| alfven-waves | Core theory thread | alfven-turbulence |
| psp-mission | Major project/mission | psp-observations |
| switchbacks | Hot discovery topic | switchbacks-theory |
| coronal-heating | Classical unsolved problem | coronal-heating |
| reconnection | Theoretical breakthrough | ideal-tearing |
| velli-voice | Communication style | academic-voice-velli |

### Step 2.2: Spawn Avatars with Task Briefs

For each skill domain, write a **task brief** (see Appendix B for template)
and dispatch via `avatar(spawn)`.

**Avatar type:** `shallow` (default) — they don't need your full memory,
just the tools and the brief.

**Dispatch pattern:** Spawn in batches of 3. Send briefs immediately via
email. Don't wait for one batch before spawning the next.

### Step 2.3: Collect, Quality-Check, and Integrate Skills

As avatars report completion:

1. **Verify with explicit commands** — do NOT trust "dispatched" or
   "I sent it." Always check:
   ```bash
   ls -la .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md
   wc -l .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md
   grep '^## ' .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md
   ```
2. **Size check:** < 50 lines → incomplete; 50-300 → typical good range;
   300+ → thorough (verify not padded)
3. **Structure check:** headings must map to the brief's requirements
4. **Content spot-check:** read opening and one substantive section
5. **Copy** to your own `.library/custom/`:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/avatar/.library/custom/<skill>/ .library/custom/
   ```

### Step 2.4: Cross-Validation Review

Use a daemon to systematically compare all skills:

**Check for:**
1. **Overlap zones** — topics covered by multiple skills
2. **Factual contradictions** — different claims about the same fact
3. **Missing links** — topics that should reference each other but don't
4. **Coverage gaps** — important topics not covered by any skill

**Output:** Integration review document (see Appendix C for template).

### Step 2.5: Build the Four-Piece Profile Suit

Each profile piece has its own rubric:

#### `profile/biography.md`
- Complete timeline (year by year)
- Positions held (start date, end date, institution)
- Honors and awards (with citation text where available)
- Key institutional roles (department chair, mission scientist, etc.)
- **Source rule:** Every date must cite a verifiable source

#### `profile/voice.md`
- Storyteller archetype documentation
- Metaphor inventory (with source timestamps)
- Humor patterns (with examples)
- Argumentation structure (generalized pattern, not one-off observations)
- Conversational markers
- **Source rule:** Every observation backed by `[source: URL @ timestamp]`
- **Footer:** *"No fabricated anecdotes. Sources from public lectures,
  interviews, and published writing only."*

#### `profile/values.md`
- Science philosophy (how they think science should work)
- Teaching philosophy (how they teach and mentor)
- Attitude toward collaboration, competition, public engagement
- Views on specific controversies or debates they've weighed in on
- **Source rule:** Claims from interviews/talks preferred over inference

#### `profile/relationships.md`
- Mentor tree (who mentored them, who they mentored)
- Co-author map (core/frequent/project tiers)
- Institutional network (where they've worked, with whom)
- Students and postdocs (current group, notable alumni)
- **Source rule:** Each relationship must cite a specific paper or source

### Step 2.6: Build Method Cards as Cognative Fingerprint

Method cards are **not** a generic checklist. They emerge from **reverse
induction** from the VA arguments. Each card answers: "What recurring method
does this person use across multiple domains?"

**The 10-card framework (from Velli case):**

| VM ID | Card Name | Minimum VA Backing |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| VM001 | Start from the Gradient | ≥3 VA |
| VM002 | Find the Critical Point | ≥3 VA |
| VM003 | Cross-Scale Connection | ≥3 VA |
| VM004 | The Expanding Box Model | ≥3 VA |
| VM005 | Theory-Driven, Data-Validated | ≥3 VA |
| VM006 | Parameterize Uncertainty | ≥3 VA |
| VM007 | Numerical Experiments | ≥3 VA |
| VM008 | Comparative Analysis | ≥3 VA |
| VM009 | Let Surprise Guide New Theory | ≥3 VA |
| VM010 | Multi-Point Synergy | ≥3 VA |

**Each card must contain:**

```
## VM00X: Card Name

**When to apply**: [Situations where this method is appropriate]

**The procedure**: [Step-by-step method, numbered]

**Why it works**: [Physical/psychological basis]

**Observed in**: [N VA — citation to specific arguments]

**Failure modes**: [When this method doesn't apply]

**Transfer hints**: [Related fields where the same pattern appears]
```

**Rule:** Cards emerge from evidence, not from generic methodology lists.
If you can't find ≥3 VA instances, you don't have a card — you have a
hypothesis.

### Step 2.7: Assemble the VA Argument Framework

Every argument in the persona follows the **7-field VA claim schema**:

```
**Claim ID**: VA001
**Domain**: [physics/methodology/culture/pedagogy]
**Claim**: [Specific assertion, not vague]
**What he did**: [Observations, derivations, simulations]
**The product**: [Paper/lecture/discovery]
**Primary results**: [Numbers, scaling laws, figures]
**Context**: [Why it matters, what it replaced, what it opened]
**Citekeys**: [1-3 BibTeX keys from subject.bib]
**Cross-refs**: [Related argument IDs: VA017, VA023]
```

**Field-level guidance:**

| Field | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| **Claim ID** | Sequential VA001, VA002, ... across all arguments |
| **Domain** | One of: physics, methodology, culture, pedagogy |
| **Claim** | ONE specific assertion. If you find "and", split it |
| **What he did** | Actions taken, not conclusions reached |
| **The product** | The tangible artifact (paper, model, dataset, lecture) |
| **Primary results** | Numbers, scaling laws, or key figures — quantitative when possible |
| **Context** | Why this matters. Include what it replaced or challenged |
| **Citekeys** | All must exist in the `.bib` file. Broken citekeys = quality failure |
| **Cross-refs** | Mandatory for connected arguments. If VA002 builds on VA001, note it |

### Step 2.8: Build the Progressive Exposure Loading Table

The entry point SKILL.md must include a loading table that tells the reader
when to load each layer:

```
| Layer | When to Load | What You Get |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Entry file** | Always | Navigation, structure overview |
| `profile/SKILL.md` | For any interaction | Big picture: biography, voice, values, relationships |
| `profile/biography.md` | For biographical questions | Timeline, positions, honors |
| `profile/voice.md` | For generating persona-like text | Speaking style, metaphors, humor |
| `profile/values.md` | For philosophical questions | Science philosophy, cultural views |
| `profile/relationships.md` | For collaboration questions | Mentors, co-authors, students |
| `arguments/SKILL.md` | For domain questions | Argument index, search guide |
| `arguments/<domain>/*.md` | For specific topics | Verifiable claims per domain |
| `methods/SKILL.md` | For "how they think" | Cognative toolkit as method cards |
```

**Authorship rule:** This table must be updated whenever the persona gains or
loses a layer. Stale tables are metadata rot.

---

## The 5 Working Patterns

These patterns emerged from the Velli case as the core of what works.

### Pattern 1: The VA Claim Schema

The 7-field template (described in §2.7) is the central data structure. Every
factual claim about the subject becomes a VA record. This structure enables:
- **Verifiability:** Every claim has a citekey
- **Cross-referencing:** Connections between arguments are explicit
- **Gap analysis:** Missing domains are visible as missing VA ranges
- **Auditability:** A script can verify all citekeys resolve

### Pattern 2: Source Discipline as Mechanisms

The source rules in §1.4 become built-in quality gates:

1. **Citekey rule:** Every VA must have ≥1 citekey. Script-verify all
   citekeys exist in the bib file.
2. **Timestamp rule:** Every voice/behavioral claim must have a
   `[source: ...]` anchor. No exceptions.
3. **Unverified rule:** If you don't have a source, mark `⚠️ [unverified]`.
   Track all unverified claims in a separate list.
4. **Never rule:** Fabricated anecdotes are NEVER allowed. Add this as a
   footer to every file.

### Pattern 3: The Four-Piece Profile Suit

Biography / Voice / Values / Relationships — each with its own rubric
(documented in §2.5). The four pieces together constitute the "who is this
person" answer. They are written to be loadable independently (each file
self-contained) but cross-referenced.

### Pattern 4: Method Cards as Cognative Fingerprint

10 method cards, each backed by ≥3 VA instances (§2.6). Cards emerge from
reverse induction — you don't decide what methods the person has and then
find examples. You find recurring patterns across the VA arguments and
inductively generalize them into cards. A card without ≥3 VA instances is
not yet proven.

### Pattern 5: Progressive Exposure Loading Table

The loading table (§2.8) is the user interface to the persona. It tells a
downstream agent exactly what to load and when. The table must be:
- **Complete:** Every layer is listed
- **Accurate:** When-to-load guidance is honest
- **Current:** Updated whenever the persona structure changes

---

## The 7 Anti-Patterns (Must NOT Do)

These are mistakes made during the Velli case. Every persona production
process must explicitly guard against them.

### Anti-Pattern 1: Metadata Rot

**Problem:** Top-level metadata (version, description, file count, entry
count) not updated when the persona changes.

**Solution:** Add a close-out step: **rewrite SKILL.md to truth** before
declaring the persona complete. Every number (file count, VA count, bib
count, token estimate) must be verified by a command, not by memory.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Token Count Inflation

**Problem:** The Velli persona was claimed to be "1.5M+ tokens" but
measured at ~90K tokens. Inflated claims erode trust.

**Solution:** Never state a token count unless you've measured it. Run:
```bash
find . -type f \( -name '*.md' -o -name '*.bib' \) -exec wc -c {} + | tail -1
```
For rough estimate: bytes ÷ 4 ≈ tokens for English text. For exact, use
`tiktoken` or your LLM's tokenizer.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Citation Discipline: Said vs Done

**Problem:** Claiming "every assertion has a citekey" while the product has
broken citekeys and `[unverified]` flags.

**Solution:** Add a **validator pass** after assembly. Script-verify:
1. All citekeys in the VA arguments exist in the `.bib` file
2. All VA entries have at least one citekey
3. All `[unverified]` flags are accounted for (count them, note them)
4. No VA entry has a citekey that doesn't exist (broken reference)

**Verification script pattern:**
```bash
# Extract all used citekeys
grep -rhoP '(?<=\*\*Citekeys\*\*:)[^\n]*' arguments/**/*.md | \
  tr ',' '\n' | sed 's/^ *//' | sort -u > /tmp/used.txt

# Extract all bib entries
grep '^\s*@' subject.bib | grep -ohP '(?<={)[^,]*' | sort -u > /tmp/all.txt

# Orphans (in arguments but not in bib)
comm -23 /tmp/used.txt /tmp/all.txt

# Unreferenced bib entries
comm -13 /tmp/used.txt /tmp/all.txt
```

### Anti-Pattern 4: Bib Bloat

**Problem:** The Velli bib file had 338 entries; only ~78 were referenced
(77% unreferenced).

**Solution:** After the validator pass, **prune the bib file**.
Reverse-generate a minimal bib by extracting only the citekeys actually
used in VA arguments. Keep the full bib in a separate file
(`<subject>-bib-full.bib`) for future use, but the shipped persona should
export a minimal, clean bib.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Three-Copy Drift

**Problem:** Maintaining parallel copies of the same skill in different
locations, letting them drift apart.

**Solution:** Single truth source: `.library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md`.
Never manually maintain parallel copies. If you need to share a skill, copy
it from the single source. If two agents work on the same skill, one must
be designated as the canonical source.

### Anti-Pattern 6: "Dispatched" ≠ "Done"

**Problem:** Assuming an action is complete because it was dispatched.
In the Velli case, avatars reported "done" but the file didn't exist.

**Solution:** Every completion claim must be verified by reading the output:
```bash
ls -la .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md
wc -l .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md
head -20 .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md
```
Include the command output in your report. Do not accept "dispatched" as
"done."

### Anti-Pattern 7: Premature Export

**Problem:** Exporting the persona before QA is complete. The correct
pipeline order is:

```
Content production → QA and validation → Metadata sync → Export
```

Each stage has a checkable gate:
- **Content production:** All files written, all VA entries complete
- **QA and validation:** Validator script passes (citekeys, sources,
  unverified tracking)
- **Metadata sync:** SKILL.md updated to reflect current state (file count,
  token estimate, version)
- **Export:** Only then is the persona ready for consumption

**No skips.** If you skip QA, you ship broken citekeys. If you skip
metadata sync, you ship stale numbers.

## The Velli Case Reference: What Was Produced

As a concrete reference, here's what the Velli impersonation produced:

| Layer | Files | Entries | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| `profile/` | 5 | Complete | biography, voice, values, relationships + index |
| `arguments/physics/*` | 8 | 85 VA | 7 domains |
| `arguments/methodology/*` | 1 | 8 VA | Thinking methods |
| `arguments/culture/*` | 1 | 7 VA | Scientific culture |
| `arguments/pedagogy/*` | 1 | 5 VA | Teaching philosophy |
| `methods/` | 1 | 10 VM | One card per method, ≥3 VA each |
| `.bib` | 1 | 338 → 78 | Full bib (338), shipped minimal (78) |
| **Total** | **19** | **105 VA + 10 VM** | **~90K tokens** |

Sanity check: if your persona has < 50 VA entries, you probably haven't
done enough intelligence gathering. If it has > 200, you may be including
noise.

---

## Skill Format Specification

Every skill in the persona follows this format:

```markdown
---
name: <kebab-case>
description: <1-2 sentence>
version: 2.0
---

# Title

## 1. Section
[Content with equations, references, analysis]

## 2. Section
...

## N. How to Discuss [Topic] as [Subject]
[Impersonation-specific guidance — bridge between knowledge and performance]

## References
[Citation chain]
```

The final "How to Discuss" section is **essential** — the bridge between
knowledge and performance.

## Timing and Resource Estimates

| Activity | Duration | Agents | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1: Intelligence | 30-60 min | 1 (main) | web_search, web_read, codex, listen |
| Phase 2: Avatar Skills | 20-40 min | 5-8 avatars | Parallel, batch-spawned |
| Cross-validation | 15-30 min | 1 daemon | Systematic comparison |
| Profile suit production | 30-60 min | 1 (main) | 4 files + entry point |
| Method card induction | 15-30 min | 1 (main) | From VA evidence |
| VA argument refinement | 20-40 min | 1 (main) | Editing, cross-referencing |
| QA + Validator pass | 10-20 min | script | Citekey verification, bib pruning |
| Metadata sync + export | 5-10 min | 1 (main) | Update SKILL.md, close-out checklist |
| **Total** | **2-5 hours** | **6-10 agents** | |

---

## Adapting to Non-Academic Subjects

| Subject type | Adaptation |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Business leader** | Replace Scholar with SEC filings, interviews, keynotes; skills: strategy, leadership style, market analysis, crisis management |
| **Artist/writer** | Replace papers with works; skills: technique, themes, influences, critical reception, creative process |
| **Historical figure** | Replace web with archival material; skills: historical context, key decisions, relationships, legacy |
| **Engineer/builder** | Replace papers with projects/patents; skills: technical approach, design philosophy, problem-solving patterns, notable projects |

Core loop is the same: **gather → decompose → specialize → integrate →
assemble.**

## Appendix A: Avatar Management Patterns

### A.1 The Report-In Pattern

Shallow avatars, upon spawning, send a brief "reporting in" message. This is
informational only — do not reply. Replying wastes a turn and breaks the
parallel flow.

### A.2 Batch Overlap Strategy

Do NOT wait for Batch 1 to fully complete before spawning Batch 2. Avatars
have variable completion times (15-40 minutes). Optimal pattern:

```
T=0min:   Spawn Batch 1 (3 avatars)
T=5min:   Spawn Batch 2 (3 more avatars)
T=10min:  Begin quality-checking Batch 1 completions
T=20min:  Most of Batch 1 complete, collect files
T=30min:  Batch 2 complete, collect remaining files
```

**Key insight:** All 6 Velli avatars completed in ~25 minutes total because
they ran in parallel. Sequential would have taken 2+ hours.

### A.3 Quality Check Workflow

**Stage 1: Size Check (instant)**
```bash
wc -l .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md
```
- < 50 lines: incomplete
- 50-100: minimal but possibly acceptable
- 100-300: typical good range
- 300+: thorough (verify not padded)

**Stage 2: Structure Check (instant)**
```bash
grep '^## ' .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md
```
Verify headings map to the brief's requirements.

**Stage 3: Content Spot-Check**
Read opening + one substantive section. Check for specific citations,
correct facts, and a "How to Discuss" section.

### A.4 File Collection

```bash
cp -r /path/to/avatar/.library/custom/<skill>/ .library/custom/
```

### A.5 Timeout Handling

Before retrying a timed-out avatar:
1. Check: `ls -la .library/custom/<skill>/SKILL.md`
2. If exists and passes QA: avatar finished before reporting done
3. If not: re-dispatch with simplified brief

- [ ] Key papers list has 8+ entries with real citation counts
- [ ] Required knowledge points are specific (not "cover everything about X")
- [ ] Output format is explicit (YAML frontmatter + section structure)
- [ ] The brief is self-contained — avatar doesn't need your full memory

### Boundary Management Principle

**Core rule:** Each topic has ONE authoritative source skill.

When a topic appears in multiple skills:
1. Designate the authority (where it's central, not tangential)
2. In non-authority skills: **2-3 sentence summary + cross-reference**
3. Cross-reference format: `For detailed analysis, see → **<skill>** §<section>`

## Appendix E: BibTeX Pruning

### Step 1: Extract Used Citekeys
```bash
grep -rhoP '(?<=\*\*Citekeys\*\*:)[^\n]*' arguments/**/*.md | \
  tr ',' '\n' | sed 's/^ *//' | sort -u > /tmp/used.txt
```

### Step 2: Extract All Bib Entries
```bash
grep '^\s*@' *.bib | grep -ohP '(?<={)[^,]*' | sort -u > /tmp/all.txt
```

### Step 3: Find Orphans and Unreferenced
```bash
comm -23 /tmp/used.txt /tmp/all.txt   # Citekeys not in bib
comm -13 /tmp/used.txt /tmp/all.txt   # Bib entries not cited
```

### Step 4: Produce Minimal Bib
Filter the bib file to only entries whose key appears in `/tmp/used.txt`.
Save full bib as `<subject>-bib-full.bib` for future use.

## Close-out Checklist

**Last section before declaring the persona complete.** Every item must be
checkable by a command (grep, wc, ls) or explicit inspection.

### 1. Structural Completeness

- [ ] Top-level `SKILL.md` exists with navigation and loading table
- [ ] `profile/` directory has 4 files: biography, voice, values,
      relationships (+ index SKILL.md)
- [ ] `arguments/SKILL.md` exists with search guide
- [ ] Arguments organized into domain directories (physics/,
      methodology/, culture/, pedagogy/)
- [ ] `methods/SKILL.md` exists with 10 method cards
- [ ] Subject's `.bib` file exists

### 2. VA Argument Completeness

- [ ] Every argument follows the 7-field VA schema
- [ ] Every VA has a unique ID (VA001, VA002, ...)
- [ ] Every VA has at least one citekey
- [ ] Every VA has `Context` and `Cross-refs` fields
- [ ] Total VA count verified: `grep -c '\*\*Claim ID\*\*' arguments/**/*.md`
- [ ] No VA has a placeholder citekey

### 3. Method Card Completeness

- [ ] 10 method cards exist (VM001–VM010)
- [ ] Each card has all 6 required sections (When, Procedure, Why,
      Observed, Failure, Transfer)
- [ ] Each card cites ≥3 VA instances
- [ ] Cards are induced from evidence, not from generic lists
- [ ] Verify: `grep -c 'Observed in' methods/SKILL.md` ≥ 10

### 4. Citation Integrity

- [ ] All citekeys in VA arguments exist in `.bib` file
- [ ] Run citekey verification script (see Appendix E)
- [ ] No orphan citekeys: `comm -23 /tmp/used.txt /tmp/all.txt` → empty
- [ ] All `[unverified]` tags are intentional and tracked
- [ ] "No fabricated anecdotes" footer in every profile file

### 5. Bib Pruning

- [ ] Shipped bib contains only actually referenced entries
- [ ] Unreferenced entries in separate `<subject>-bib-full.bib`
- [ ] Unreferenced count documented

### 6. Metadata Accuracy

- [ ] SKILL.md version matches the file content
- [ ] File count in SKILL.md matches actual: `find . -type f -name '*.md' | wc -l`
- [ ] Token estimate is measured, not guessed:
      ```
      find . -type f \( -name '*.md' -o -name '*.bib' \) | xargs wc -c | tail -1
      ```
- [ ] Loading table is current (no stale layer references)

### 7. Anti-Pattern Guard

- [ ] No metadata rot (all numbers verified by command)
- [ ] No token count inflation (numbers are measured, not guessed)
- [ ] No citation discipline failure (validator pass done, results clean)
- [ ] No bib bloat (minimal bib produced, full bib archived)
- [ ] No three-copy drift (single SKILL.md is canonical)
- [ ] No "dispatched = done" (all files verified by `ls` and `wc`)
- [ ] No premature export (pipeline: content → QA → metadata → export)

### 8. Final Verification Commands

Run and capture output:

```bash
# File tree
find . -type f | sort

# Total file count
find . -type f | wc -l

# Token estimate (bytes/4)
find . -type f \( -name '*.md' -o -name '*.bib' \) -exec wc -c {} + | tail -1

# VA count
grep -r '\*\*Claim ID\*\*' arguments/ | wc -l

# Method card count
grep -c '^## VM' methods/SKILL.md

# Bib entry count
grep -c '^\s*@' *.bib

# Used vs total citekey counts
wc -l /tmp/used.txt /tmp/all.txt
```
